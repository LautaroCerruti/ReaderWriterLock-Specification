  Let {C} be a variable, a nested closed list including only distinct variables or
  a term of the form [X|Y] or {X/Y}, where X and Y are distinct variables. In
  this case {C} is called {CT}. In all cases all the variables in {C} must
  not be used anywhere else. Let {V} be a variable distinct from all the variables
  in {C} and not used anywhere else. {V} is called {Param}. Let {G} be a {log} goal,
  called {F}. Let {P} be a conjunction of {FP}. p(x,...,y) is
  a functional predicate iff for each x,... there is only one y such that
  p(x,...,y) holds. The {Is} predicate (see h(int)) is a functional predicate
  w.r.t. its first argument. Then a RIS is a set term of the form:
 
  {RIS}({C} in {D},[{V},...],{G},{T},{P})
  
  where {D}, called {Dom}, can be any set term including a RIS, and {T}, called
  {Patt}, is any term but a RIS. In this case the RIS denotes the set 
  {x | exists([{C},{V},...],{C} in {D} & {G} & x={T} & {P})}. Note that RIS admit a list of
  parameters.
  
  {log} also provides the following simplified forms of RIS:
  
  {RIS}({C} in {D},[{V},...],{G})

  {RIS}({C} in {D},{G})
    implemented as {RIS}({C} in {D},[],{G},{C},true)

  Functional predicates can be removed if the let/3 predicate (see h(q)) is
  conveniently used as {G}. For example, instead of:
                      ris(X in D,[Y],Y in B,X,Y is X + 1)
  write
                      ris(X in D,let([Y],Y is X + 1, Y in B))

      otherwise Prolog unification is applied.

      denotes the negation of equality (not equal)
    {Set}({T})
      {T} is a set term
    {Pair}({T})
      {T} is an ordered pair, i.e. {T} unifies with [_,_]

    {Rel}({T})
      {T} is a binary relation, i.e. is a set of ordered pairs

      {T} is a partial function, i.e. is a set of ordered pairs such that if two
      pairs have the same first component then they have the same second
      component

    sin: Constraints relating sets with integers (e.g. cardinality, minimum of a
         set, etc.)
    rel: Constraints dealing with relation algebra (e.g. domain, composition,

  Some of the quantifiers provided by {log} are the following (see more in Sect.
  6 of the user's manual). Let {C}, {D}, {G}, {V} and {P} be as in RIS(see h(ris)). Let {H}
  be a {log} goal containing variable {X} which is not used anywhere else, and let
  {A} be a variable, an extensional set, an interval or an intensional set. Let
  \forall be the universal quantifier (do not confuse it with {Fa}) and let
  \exists be the existential quantifier (do not confuse it with {Ex}). Then:
    {Fe}({C} in {D},{G})
      denotes (\forall {C} : {C} in {D} ==> {G}). {Fe} is called restricted universal
      quantifier (RUQ).
    {Nfe}({C} in {D},{G})
      denotes (exists {C} : {C} in {D} & neg({G}))
    {Ex}({C} in {D},{G})
      denotes (exists {C} : {C} in {D} & {G}). {Ex} is called restricted existential
      quantifier (REQ).
    {Nex}({C} in {D},{G})
      denotes (\forall {C} : {C} in {D} ==> neg({G}))
    {L}([{V},...],{P},{G})
      denotes (exists {V},... : {P} & {G})
    {Nl}([{V},...],{P},{G})
      denotes (exists {V},... : {P} & neg({G}))
    {Fa}({X} in {A}, {H})
    {Fa}({X} in {A}, {Ex}({W},{H}))
    {Fa}({X} in {A}, {Ex}([{W}...],{H}))
      {W},... are variables local to {H}

  If it is necessary to introduce existential variables in {Fe} then use {L}.
  For example, foreach([X,Y] in R, let([V], V is Y + 1, V in A)) introduces {V} as
  an existential variable.
  
  Usually users only need {Fe}, {Ex} and {L}. The negation of {Fe} is
  {Ex} and vice versa; the negation of {L} is {Nl} and vice versa.
  
  All quantifiers but {Fa} can be used as constraints. See {Fa} in Sect. 6.2 of
  the user's manual.
  
  Use {Ex} and {L} to avoid the introduction of existential variables in
  user-defined predicates. {log} can deal with existential variables introduced
  by means of {L}.

  {log} type system supports the following types:
    {At}
      any Prolog atom different from {Int}, {Str} and any atom appearing in {Enum} and
      {Sum} declarations can be a type, called basic or uninterpreted type. The
      elements of {At} are terms of the form {At}{SC}{A} where {A} is a Prolog
      atom or an integer number.
    {Int}
      is the type of the integer numbers
    {Str}
      is the type of the character strings
    {Enum}([{Cons},...])
      is an enumerated type whose elements ar the elements of the list
      [{Cons},...], where {Cons} is a Prolog atom. The list must be a set of at
      least two elements. The elements cannot appear in any other type
      definition.
    {Sum}([{Cons},{Cons}({T},...),...])
      is a union or disjoint sum type whose elements are built by the
      constructors {Cons}. {Cons} can be any atom not used in the definition of
      other types. If {Cons} has arguments they must be types.
    {Osb}{T},{U}{Csb}
      is a Cartesian product type. Its elements are ordered pairs. {T} and {U} are
      types.
    {Set}({T})
      is the powerset type whose elements are sets of type {T}.
    {Rel}({T},{U})
      is a synonym for {Set}({Osb}{T},{U}{Csb}), i.e. the type of all binary relations of
      type {Osb}{T},{U}{Csb}.

  If {V} is a variable and {T} is a type, {Dec}({V},{T}) is a predicate stating that {V} is
  of type {T}. {Decp}(p({T},{U}...)) declares the type of the first argument of
  predicate p to be {T}, of the second argument to be {U}, and so forth. This
  declaration must precede p's definition. The declaration {Decpp} is used
  to declare the type of polymorphic predicates. {DT}({A},{T}) declares {A}, an
  atom, as a synonym of type {T}. From this point on {A} can be used in place of {T}.

    generates a file named {F}-vc.{E} containing the {VCc} (VC)

    after consulting {F}-vc.{E}.
  {C}{F}({T},{Conf})
    attempts to discharge all the VC generated for the specification. Each VC is
    run for at most {T} ms and using the configuration {Conf} (see h(thr)).
    The result of this command is a report describing the status of each VC. The
    status is one of: {OK}, the VC has been discharged; {Err}, the VC could not
    be discharged because {log} found a counterexample; and {TO}, {log} could
    not prove nor disprove the VC in {T} milliseconds.

  The process starts with command {TTF}/1 followed by {DNF}/1, see below.
